The implementation was simple but not very modular since the loss and gradient were computed in a single monolithic function. This is manageable for a simple two-layer network, but would become impractical as we move to bigger models. Ideally we want to build networks using a more modular design so that we can implement different layer types in isolation and then snap them together into models with different architectures.\n","\n","In this exercise we will implement fully-connected networks using a more modular approach. For each layer we will implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass, like this:\n","\n","```python\n","def layer_forward(x, w):\n","  \"\"\" Receive inputs x and weights w \"\"\"\n","  # Do some computations ...\n","  z = # ... some intermediate value\n","  # Do some more computations ...\n","  out = # the output\n","   \n","  cache = (x, w, z, out) # Values we need to compute gradients\n","   \n","  return out, cache\n","```\n","\n","The backward pass will receive upstream derivatives and the `cache` object, and will return gradients with respect to the inputs and weights, like this:\n","\n","```python\n","def layer_backward(dout, cache):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Receive dout (derivative of loss with respect to outputs) and cache,\n","  and compute derivative with respect to inputs.\n","  \"\"\"\n","  # Unpack cache values\n","  x, w, z, out = cache\n","  \n","  # Use values in cache to compute derivatives\n","  dx = # Derivative of loss with respect to x\n","  dw = # Derivative of loss with respect to w\n","  \n","  return dx, dw\n","```\n","\n","After implementing a bunch of layers this way, we will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures.\n","\n","In addition to implementing fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth, we will also explore different update rules for optimization, and introduce Batch/Layer Normalization as a tool to more efficiently optimize deep networks.\n","  "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"id":"zif4PgizLaZO"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/Users/novellaalvina/Documents/US/UTAH/Lessons/MS/Fall 2024/CS 6353/CS_6353/assignment3/cs6353/datasets\n","--2024-10-07 18:28:37--  https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz\n","Resolving www.cs.toronto.edu (www.cs.toronto.edu)... 128.100.3.30\n","Connecting to www.cs.toronto.edu (www.cs.toronto.edu)|128.100.3.30|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 170498071 (163M) [application/x-gzip]\n","Saving to: ‘cifar-10-python.tar.gz’\n","\n","cifar-10-python.tar 100%[===================>] 162.60M  29.1MB/s    in 7.0s    \n","\n","2024-10-07 18:28:44 (23.3 MB/s) - ‘cifar-10-python.tar.gz’ saved [170498071/170498071]\n","\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_4\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/readme.html\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/test_batch\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_3\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/batches.meta\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_2\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_5\n","x cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_1\n","/Users/novellaalvina/Documents/US/UTAH/Lessons/MS/Fall 2024/CS 6353/CS_6353/assignment3\n"]}],"source":["# This mounts your Google Drive to the Colab VM.\n","# from google.colab import drive\n","# drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","# TODO: Enter the foldername in your Drive where you have saved the unzipped\n","# assignment folder, e.g. 'cs6353/assignments/assignment3/'\n","# FOLDERNAME = 'assignment3'\n","# assert FOLDERNAME is not None, \"[!] Enter the foldername.\"\n","\n","# Now that we've mounted your Drive, this ensures that\n","# the Python interpreter of the Colab VM can load\n","# python files from within it.\n","# import sys\n","# sys.path.append('/content/drive/My Drive/{}'.format(FOLDERNAME))\n","\n","# This downloads the CIFAR-10 dataset to your Drive\n","# if it doesn't already exist.\n","%cd /Users/novellaalvina/Documents/US/UTAH/Lessons/MS/Fall\\ 2024/CS\\ 6353/CS_6353/assignment3/cs6353/datasets\n","!bash get_datasets.sh\n","%cd ../..\n","\n","# Install requirements from colab_requirements.txt\n","# TODO: Please change your path below to the colab_requirements.txt file\n","# !
